# Portfolio-Optimization

In this section, we briefly introduce the principles we employed to choose an optimal portfolio. The Modern Portfolio Theory posits that through diversification, investors have the potential to achieve the highest expected return while maintaining a specific level of volatility [1]. With this concept, we can identify all the portfolios that are efficient and lie along the efficient frontier. Sharpe (1994) introduced the Sharpe ratio, a metric that quantifies the rate of risk-adjusted (excess) return for a portfolio. Moreover, by combining the risk-free asset with an efficient portfolio situated on the efficient frontier, we can derive the tangential portfolio, where the Sharpe ratio is maximized, offering the most favorable trade-off between risk and return.
